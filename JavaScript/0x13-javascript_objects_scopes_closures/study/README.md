# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

* **module.exports** is used to export modules.
* Objects are collections of related data and functionalities. They consist of variables and functions commonly referred 
to as properties and methods.
* Creating an object in JS requires firstly assigning it to a variable.
* Arrow functions do not have their own *this* context, but inherit it from the surronding scope. regular function expressions access the *this* context of the object they belong to.
* Objects consist of properties (data items) and functions (methods)
* Objects can be created as object literals or instantiated from Classes
* **Objects properties and methods can be accessed uusing *dot notation*. The object acts as the namespace (It must be entered first to access anything in the object)**
* An object property itself can be an object.
* To access inner object properties of object properties, chain with an extra '.' to access its items
* bracket notation is an alternative to dot notation as it uses the name associated with each properties value. **This property is why the are sometimes referred as assosiative arrays** 
* Dot notation is often preferred to bracket notation because it is clear and concise
* Although sometimes dot notation cannot be used. This are instances where object property is in a variable.
* Object members can be retrieved as well as being set (updated)
* Aside updating object properties and methods, object properties and methods can be created
* Bracket notation can be used to set not only members value dynamically, but also member names.
* *this* refers to the current object the code being executed
