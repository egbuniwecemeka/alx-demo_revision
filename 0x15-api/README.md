## API
An application programming interface is a set of routines, protocols and tools used in building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact.APIs are like the buiding blocks, while the programmer puts them together.

## Explaining API in plain english
To a browser(client) a server is an API. This means everytime an individual visits a website, he/she interacts with the server's API
Note: A server is not the same as an API (it is just a part of the server that receives requests and serves responses)

## How is the API of a particular server different from anotheer
THe difference in servers APIs lie in the format of the request and the response. To display respnses, browsers expect presentational code(HTML) while API calls are usually raw data (JSON) format.

## Microservices
These are servers that that perform helper functions for the main application server.
