# Debugging

## Process of debugging

* First identify the process of recreating the problem.
* Simplify the input program(eg divide-and-conquer approach) can be employed
* Use debugger tools to examine program states. Likewise tracing can be used. (eg using print statements to check values state at various points).

## Debugging techniques
* Interactive debugiing
* Print debugging or Tracing
* Activity tracing
* Remote debugging
* Post-mortem debugging
* Wolf-fence algorithm debugging(eg git bisect)
* Record and replay debugging (eg Mozilla free it debugging tool)
* Time travel debugging
* Delta debugging - automating test cases simplification
* Saff Squeeze - isolating failure within test case using progressive parts of failing test
* Causality debugging - Track cause effect computation eg null pointer dereferences.

## Antidebugging
Implementing one or more techniques in a computer code that hinders debugging target processes. Techniques in anti debugging include



## Task

* Task 3
* Tips - Understanding the conditioning of a leap year
* A year that is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 is a leap year.
* Also, if the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year
* A year is a leap year if it meets either the first combined condition (divisible by 4 and not by 100) or the second condition (divisible by 400).
* Work on test cases for days below 1 and above 31 and months below 1 and above 12(Unfinished)
