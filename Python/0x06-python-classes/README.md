# Object Oriented Programming

* Procedure-oriented programming - Functions
* Object oriented programming - A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.
* Variables belonging to a class or object are known as fields
* Functions belonging to a class are known as methods
* Collectively, fields and variables are referred to as attributes

Fields are of two types namely;

* instance/object variables - belongs to each instance/object
* class variables - belongs to the class.

## The self

The self variable refers to the object itself

## __init__ method
This method is run as soon as the object of a class is instantiated

* __init__ method is useful for initialization (passing initial values to objects)

## Classes and Variables

The functionality part of classes and objects includes __methods__ while the data part (fields) of classes and variables deals with the __namespaces__.

2 types of fields
Class variable - shared. Can be accessed by all instances of the class. There is only one class variable through the class and a change to it reflects in all class instances.
